meta-phytec
==========

This is the location for PHYTEC maintained BSPs.

Please see the README files contained in the individual BSP layers for
BSP-specific information.

If you have problems with or questions about a particular BSP, please
contact the maintainer listed in the MAINTAINERS file directly. Please
try to do the following first:

  - look in the Yocto Project Bugzilla
    (http://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/) to see if a problem has
    already been reported

  - look through recent entries of the Yocto
    (https://lists.yoctoproject.org/pipermail/yocto/) mailing list
    archives to see if other people have run into similar problems or
    had similar questions answered.

The meta-phytec layer handles entities on cooperation level. That is:

  - license files
  - logo and graphic design files
  - patches for yocto
  - software recipes not found in yocto

It servers as an integration level for all BSPs developed by PHYTEC.
Sublayers should be designed not to create interdependencies.
